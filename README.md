# üóÇÔ∏è **Backup Automation with BorgBackup** üì¶

## üöÄ **Overview**
This repository contains scripts to automate **database** and **file/folder** backups using **BorgBackup**. It allows you to back up your databases and important files, while keeping backups organized and encrypted. The script handles everything from database dumps to remote backups on an SSH server.

## üíª **Getting Started**
### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smsheese/borgBackupScripts.git
cd borgBackupScripts
```

### 2. Create and Configure `.env` file
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```
Update the `.env` file with the appropriate details, such as:
- **Database Details** (e.g., MySQL/MariaDB)
- **Backup Directories** for files/folders
- **BorgBackup Configuration** (remote server, compression settings, etc.)

> **Note:** Ensure that you enter valid SSH credentials and set up your remote server for BorgBackup.

### 3. Run the Setup Script
Run the `setup.sh` script to initialize everything:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
This will:
- Check if **BorgBackup** is installed.
- Create necessary SSH keys for authentication.
- Initialize Borg repositories on your remote server.
- Help set up **cron jobs** for automated backups.

## üîß **Important Script Details**
The scripts `database_backup.sh` and `files_backup.sh` are responsible for the backup process.

### Database Backup Script
- **MySQL/MariaDB Dumps:** The script connects to your database and dumps all databases except for system ones (configurable; you can add other databases that you want to exclude).
- **Borg Command:** The databases are backed up to your remote Borg repository using compression (`lzma` by default).
  
  Example command:
  ```bash
  borg create --compression lzma --stats "$BORG_REPO_DB::databases-$TIMESTAMP" "$BACKUP_DIR/databases"
  ```

### Files/Folders Backup Script
- **File Exclusions:** The script will exclude directories like `node_modules` or `.git` by default.
- **Borg Command:** It backs up the specified files/folders to your remote Borg repository.

  Example command:
  ```bash
  borg create --compression lzma --stats --exclude */node_modules/* "$BORG_REPO_FILES::files-$TIMESTAMP" $SOURCE_DIRS_LIST
  ```

### Cron Jobs
Cron jobs are set up to back up your databases and files every hour. You can customize the backup frequency by modifying the cron job entries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Borg Backup Flags**
You can modify the `.env` file to adjust the following Borg flags:
- **Compression Type** (`BORG_COMPRESSION`): You can set this to `lzma`, `zlib`, `bzip2`, etc.
- **Retention Policies** (`BORG_KEEP_DB`, `BORG_KEEP_FILES`): Configure how long backups are retained (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.).

For example:
```bash
# Retain hourly backups for 7 days, daily for 30 days
BORG_KEEP_DB="--keep-hourly=168 --keep-daily=30"
```
